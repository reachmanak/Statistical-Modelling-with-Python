# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
Build statistical model to understand how the city bike stations are present in various locations and the parameters affecting it.

## Process
Aim to access the multiple APIâ€™s

Merged the data into one dataframe for further analysis

Transforming and performing EDA to analyse
Build statistical model and interpret the result


## Results
As per EDA, I could say that more bikes were present in areas with more popular eateries. However, after the OLS model, I am at conclusion that the data was inconclusive. With more data and more coverage of fields the prominence of independent variables would develop and increase.

## Challenges 
-Cleaning and structuring JSON data.
-Parsing te JSON data into lists was hard but learnt something new.
-Very less parameters for observations


## Future Goals
Would love to have more time to understand the parameters further and collect as much data as possible to find statistically significance in model.
